    Hello! My name is Alivia Pham. I'm a senior pursuing a BS in Information Technology and a minor in film studies. I was originally a Film Major, but after deciding film wasn't a great idea for my future prospects (and to prevent burnout over a fun hobby), I switched to IT instead. I have a brief experience with web development as I took INFOTC2830 last semester, and I really enjoyed the course despite not being very skilled at coding. Because of that, I would love to use this course to solidify my foundational knowledge of web development. I don't know what I want to do in my future career, but I think that web development is a great option for me because it's a good balance between technical and creative skills. Also, this class is required for the Information Systems & Learning Technology certificate, so I'd be taking it even if I didn't enjoy web development! In my spare time, I love to crochet! (:
