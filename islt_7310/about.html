        <h1>Alivia Pham</h1>
        <h3>Let me introduce myself.</h3>
            <p>If you told past-Alivia that future-Alivia would willingly decide to go to school for Information Technology instead of English or Music or Film or quite literally anything that's not STEM-related, then past-Alivia would laugh in your face. <em>Who's laughing now?</em></p>
            <p><br><br>Hello there. I'm Alivia Pham. With a BS in Information Technology in one hand and a minor in Film Studies in the other, it's now my  turn to enter the workforce. When I was younger, I loved to exert creativity in every aspect of my life. Upon entering university, I decided to lean into the technicalities instead. Turns out, you can <em>combine</em> them both. After dabbling in a variety of aspects of IT (digital media design, coding, cyber security, etc), I'd love to pursue a career that allows me to use these freshly minted skills and put that creativity and technicality together.
            <br><br>As past-Alivia's idol used to say (Hannah Montana)...<blockquote>you get the best of both worlds!</blockquote>
