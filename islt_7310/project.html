                <br><br>- Cotiviti is a healthcare and IT analytics company that works to provide technology, data, and expertise for over 40 healthcare and insurance clients to enhance their claims payment accuracy. A combination of healthcare, information technology, and economics, Cotiviti is a multifaceted company that performs to reshape the experience of the consumer. My current position specifically works to supply remote technical support for clients, as well as logging inquiries and documentation through our internal problem management database, maintaining knowledge of company products and customer service processes, and aiding in any other technical roles as needed.
                <br>- This is a new position for me, having only started in August. That being said, this is easily the most intensive position I have ever had the pleasure of taking on. With so many tasks for me to eventually take on, I am positive I will have an entirely new perspective on IT within the first month.</p>
            <img src="mizzou.png" style="display:flex;width:20%;float:right;margin-right:11%;margin-top:6%;"><br><p class="p11">Clerical Student Assistant & Peer Learning Assistant - University of Missouri - 2019-2022
                <br><br>- The University of Missouri-Columbia, founded in 1839, is Missouri's largest university and the flagship of the four-campus University of Missouri System. It's a public land- grant research university in Columbia, Missouri, Mizzou is home to over 30,000 students. As one of them, I of course ended up working on-campus for most of my time there. My position was held in two main locations, Ellis Library and various residential halls, and my time was spent mainly working to allocate merchandise for the appropriate clientele, utilize administrative databases to manage data for students and buildings, greet guests, and direct inquiries to designated departments. As a Peer Learning Assistant (PLA), I worked remotely to facilitate a university's IT course, "Game Theory and Design", as an undergraduate teacher's assistant. In doing so, I graded assignments, answered emails, held office hours for 80+ students, and troubleshooted students' issues with in-class software: Epic Games Unreal Engine.
                <br>- Both of these positions were a means to an end. I applied to Ellis Library and Residential life to ensure I had work during my semesters at school, but I don't think very much of my time in these roles. Were they fun, yes, but ultimately I believe I have moved on.</p>
            <img src="hibachi.png" style="display:flex;width:20%;float:left;margin-left:8%;margin-top:7%;"><br><p class="p12">Host & Cashier - Hibachi Grill - 2017-2021
                <br><br>- Hibachi Grill is a locally-run Chinese-American buffet in my hometown. In a small but mighty strip mall full of both mom 'n pop shops and major chains, Hibachi is certainly not for the weak, hosting dozens of dishes, along with a sushi bar and hibachi station for its customers. My position was not one either. As the primary host and cashier to the large establishment, it was my duty to direct guest flow to maximize efficiency and minimize wait time, manage transactions of party sizes reaching 100+ and checks reaching $1000+, and liaising management and client appointment and complaint resolution.
                <br>- Working at Hibachi Grill was quite a terrible experience, to be frank. Poor management, rude customers, mediocre food, so on and so forth. Despite that, Hibachi seemed to be a hub for many different people, all with only one thing in common: their love for that god- forsaken restaurant. I'm glad I quit.</p>
                <img src="mcd.png" style="display:flex;width:12%;float:right;margin-right:14%;margin-top:5%;"><br><p class="p13">Cashier & Food Runner - McDonald's - 2016-2017
                <br><br>- I don't think this needs any introduction, but McDonald's Corporation is an American- based but international fast food chain. Founded in 1940 in California, McDonald's has become a household menu all across the globe, featuring everything from breakfast items like McMuffins and McGriddles to lunch items like Big Macs and Quarter Pounders to staples like fries and ice cream. My position as a cashier and occasional food runner was only a cog in the McDonald's machine, necessary to provide a high level of customer service during high-volume operations, mastery of the point-of-service computer system for taking orders, and handling transactions exchanges efficiently and accurately.
                <br>- Funnily enough, I believe that my experience at McDonald's was one that really shaped me as a person. Not necessarily a great experience, I came out of it with the firm belief that everyone should hold a food-service/retail position at least once in their lives. I still stand by that today.</p>
